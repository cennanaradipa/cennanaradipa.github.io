Hi there, I'm Cenna, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Singapore Synchrotron Light Source, National University of Singapore.

I am working on optical properties of strongly correlated electron systems (cool materials) and now I've been getting closer into applied physics. Some of works are in plasmonics, hybrid perovskites, gold quantum dots, and recently it's getting more multidisciplinary. I'm an expert on spectroscopic ellipsometry and have dabbled in theoretical density functional theory (DFT) and X-ray synchrotron methods. Curious on entrepreneurship and looking into sustainable projects to dive deeper. 

I'm an avid gym goer but somehow still manages to lift featherweight and sometime takes pretty good pictures on my phone. Passionate for food and also have quite a number of reviews on google maps. Going through life with the most wonderful wife and two kids, Alhamdulillah. 

Happy to discuss anything so we can collaborate in academia or other projects. Contact me below! Have a wonderful day.
